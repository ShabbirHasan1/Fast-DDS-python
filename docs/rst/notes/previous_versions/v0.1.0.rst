Version 0.1.0
-------------

This first **beta** release includes the following features:

* Basic API for publishing and subscribing

Known limitations:

* QoS modification is not supported on Python.
  It is possible to create a QoS object with the default constructor or retrieve it with the :code:`get_qos` methods
  of the entities, but it is not possible to modify the QoS values.
  Please, use XML configuration files if non-default QoS are needed.
* Status listeners are not available.
  Even though Python will not complain if a listener is added to an entity, its callbacks will not be triggered.
* Support in `Fast DDS Gen <https://fast-dds.docs.eprosima.com/en/latest/fastddsgen/usage/usage.html>`_ is also
  limited to structs of simple types (no nested structs nor arrays or maps).
